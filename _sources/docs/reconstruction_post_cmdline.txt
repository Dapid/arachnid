Post Processing Protocol
========================

This protocol describes post-processing of the single-particle reconstruction run
by either Relion or SPIDER.

Relion and SPIDER
=================

The following describes post-processing of either SPIDER or Relion alignment
files.

Angular Distribution
--------------------

The distribution of the projections in 3D space is an important factor in the quality of
a reconstruction. It indicates areas on the reconstruction that may be artifactual or just
low-resolution due to missing projections.

The `ara-coverage` script, by default, maps a visual histogram of projection distribution
on a 2D projection of a sphere.
