Python Modules by Christoph Gohlke
----------------------------------

These modules contain some fantastic routines for handling angle conventions in Euler, quaternion and
rotation matrix.

 - transformations.py 
 - transformations.c

HealPix
-------

This library contains a set of functions for discretizing Euler angles and provides a uniform distribution
over the surface of a sphere under certain assumptions.

EMAN2/Sparx
------------

This grayscale image processing suite provides a number of the basic functions that Arachnid depends on
including:

	- Reading and Writing Images in various formats
	- Basic image processing functions such as Cross-correlation
	- Other utilities functions such as peak search
